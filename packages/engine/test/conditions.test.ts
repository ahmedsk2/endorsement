/**
 * The three Hard placement types (P2 Task 10): `overlap_block`, `vacation_block`, `eligibility`.
 *
 * ## The corpus is the assertion, and it is loaded from disk
 *
 * Every case is a JSON file under `fixtures/conditions/`, validated against the contract's own
 * `Fixture` definition and then run through the REAL `evaluate()` and `coverage()` — not through a
 * hand-called predicate. That is deliberate: the emission rule, the severity stamp and the ordering
 * are properties of the pipeline, and a test calling `evaluate` on the module directly would assert
 * the predicate while leaving the three things most likely to be wrong at the horizon edge
 * untested.
 *
 * `why` is mandatory and each one names the SHAPE the case exists to catch, in enough detail that
 * the next author can tell whether the number in it is the point or an accident. `fixtures/README.md`
 * states the rest, including that the corpus is synthetic permanently.
 *
 * ## What is asserted here and not in a fixture
 *
 * Three things a JSON case cannot express: that CG-01's `scope` actually narrows (a scope silently
 * ignored makes a condition do MORE than the gate says); that a duty naming somebody the context
 * does not describe THROWS rather than passing for want of data; and that `eligibility`'s
 * *"auto-fill order"* half is absent — refused by the schema, and absent from the module's source.
